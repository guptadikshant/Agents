Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that I will not be able to make it to the meeting scheduled for 10 AM in the conference room. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please let me know if there are any important updates or if we can reschedule for another time.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
